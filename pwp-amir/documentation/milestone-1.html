<h1>PWP Milestone 1</h1>

<h2>Purpose, Audience, and Goal</h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of this Personal Website Project is to create an informative and visually appealing platform that showcases the beauty and properties of crystals and semi-precious gemstones, as well as the unique jewelry pieces I create using these materials. This website will serve as both an educational resource and an online portfolio of my work.</p>


<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>The target audience for this website includes crystal enthusiasts, jewelry lovers, and individuals interested in the metaphysical properties of gemstones. This audience ranges from beginners seeking to learn about crystals to experienced collectors looking for unique jewelry pieces. The audience is likely to be predominantly female, aged 25-55, with an interest in natural healing, spirituality, and fashion.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>The primary goal of this website is to increase awareness and appreciation for crystals and semi-precious gemstones, while showcasing my jewelry creations. Specifically, I aim to:
    1. Educate visitors about various crystals and their properties, increasing site traffic by 20% within six months of launch.
    2. Showcase at least 30 unique jewelry pieces, updating the collection monthly.
    3. Generate inquiries about custom jewelry orders, aiming for at least 5 inquiries per month within the first year.
    4. Build an email subscriber list of 500 crystal and jewelry enthusiasts within the first year for future marketing efforts.</p>
